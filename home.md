## üèÖ CERTIFICATIONS: Yes, but Smart Ones

If you need **1 signal**, I recommend:

|Certificate|Platform|Value|
|---|---|---|
|‚úÖ Google Advanced Data Analytics|Coursera|Good credibility + career cert|
|‚úÖ IBM Data Science Certificate|Coursera|Industry recognized|
|Optional|Kaggle Notebooks|Public reputation builder|
|Optional|DataCamp|Practical, but less known in hiring|

üìù Tip: Don‚Äôt get stuck on certificates. One good cert + 2‚Äì3 solid GitHub projects is **stronger than 5 certs** with no portfolio.
