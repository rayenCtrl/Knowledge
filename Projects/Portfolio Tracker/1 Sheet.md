Let's create a structured project plan for a Portfolio Tracker that will help you learn Python and finance concepts while building something practical. I'll break this down into manageable steps and create a Notion-style table for tracking progress.

###  Project Overview

A Portfolio Tracker is an excellent first project because it:

- Combines Python programming with financial concepts
- Has clear, measurable goals
- Can be expanded incrementally
- Provides immediate practical value

###  Project Structure

Let's break this down into clear phases and tasks:

1. **Phase 1: Data Collection**  - Connect to financial data sources
  - Implement data cleaning
  - Set up basic data storage


2. **Phase 2: Portfolio Management**  - Create portfolio class structure
  - Implement position tracking
  - Add basic calculations


3. **Phase 3: Analysis Features**  - Add performance metrics
  - Implement risk calculations
  - Create basic visualizations



Here's your Notion-style project tracking table:

| Phase | Task | Status | Priority | Dependencies | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Set up Python environment | ❌ | High | - | Install required packages |
| 1 | Connect to YFinance API | ❌ | High | Environment | Basic stock data retrieval |
| 1 | Implement data cleaning | ❌ | Medium | API Connection | Handle missing values |
| 2 | Create Portfolio class | ❌ | High | Data Collection | Basic structure |
| 2 | Add position tracking | ❌ | Medium | Portfolio Class | Buy/sell functionality |
| 3 | Implement performance metrics | ❌ | Medium | Position Tracking | Returns calculation |
| 3 | Add basic visualization | ❌ | Low | Performance Metrics | Simple plots |

###  Getting Started

1. **Phase 1 Tasks**  - Install required packages: `yfinance`, `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Set up basic project structure
  - Create first data collection script


2. **Phase 2 Tasks**  - Create `Portfolio` class
  - Implement basic position tracking
  - Add transaction history


3. **Phase 3 Tasks**  - Add return calculations
  - Implement basic risk metrics
  - Create simple visualizations



###  Progress Tracking Tips

1. **Daily Updates**  - Mark completed tasks
  - Add notes about challenges
  - Document solutions found


2. **Weekly Review**  - Update status columns
  - Adjust priorities as needed
  - Plan next week's focus


3. **Monthly Assessment**  - Review overall progress
  - Evaluate learning outcomes
  - Adjust project scope if needed



Would you like me to elaborate on any of these phases or provide more specific guidance for getting started with the first phase?
